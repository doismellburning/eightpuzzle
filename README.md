I figured it was about time I tried writing some Haskell, given my love for type systems.

So, here's a Haskell implementation of an "n-puzzle solver" as described in http://6brand.com/solving-8-puzzle-with-artificial-intelligence.html

I'd really appreciate feedback / advice / criticism as pull requests or issues please!
